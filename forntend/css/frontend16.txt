Q) What is the difference between JavaScript and Java ?


JavaScript					Java
----------------				---------
It is a scripting language.			It is a non-scripting language.	

It is a object based programming language.	It is a object oriented programming language.

It is a weakly typed checking language.		It is a strongly typed checking language.

We can't run individually.			We can run invidually.

It requires browser window for execution.	It does not required browser window for execution.

It is a simple language.			It is a complex language.


JavaScript History
===================
JavaScript originally known as LiveScript.

LiveScript was developed by Netscape Corporation in late 1990's.

LiveScript was developed by using C language syntax's.

In 1995,Brenden Eich the popular scientist of Netscape Corporation renamed LiveScript to JavaScript.

The offical name of javascript is ECMA script.

ECMA stands for Europeon Company Manufacturer Association.

Advantages of JavaScript
========================
1) It is used to develop interactive web pages.

2) It will display dialog boxes and popup boxes.

3) It is used to perform client side form validation.

4) It is a weakly/loosely typed checking language.

5) It is used to add dynamic content to a web page.

6) It is used to develop dynamic(responsive) web pages.

7) It supports Date and Time.

8) It supports Cookies.

8) It supports drop down menu.

and etc.


JavaScript syntax
=================
To write javascript code we need to use <script> tag.

ex:
	<script type="text/javascript">
		stmt1;
		stmt2;
		stmt3;
	</script>

	Here "type" attribute is optional.
	Here simicolon is optional.


Sublime Editor
===============

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
				document.write("Welcome to Javascript")
		</script>
</body>
</html>


ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
				document.writeln("Welcome to Javascript");

				document.writeln("This is Niyaz sir class");
		</script>
</body>
</html>

In scripting language, we can't declare markup language directly.

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
				document.writeln("Welcome to Javascript");
				<br>	
				document.writeln("This is Niyaz sir class");
		</script>
</body>
</html>

To overcome above limitation we need to use below code.

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
				document.writeln("Welcome to Javascript");
				document.writeln("<br>");	
				document.writeln("This is Niyaz sir class");
		</script>
</body>
</html>

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
				document.writeln("<h2>Welcome to Javascript</h2>");	
				document.writeln("<p style='color:red'>This is Niyaz sir class</p>");
		</script>
</body>
</html>

If a program contains HTML, CSS and javascript then it is called DHTML. 

DHTML stands for Dynamic Hypertext Markup language.

JavaScript Engine
==================
JavaScript Engine allows us to execute scripting code in browser window.

JavaScript engine is used to convert user understandable scripting language to machine understandable scripting language.

Every browser contains javascript engine.

We have following list of javascript engines as given below.

ex:
	Browser 		Engine
	--------		-------
	Chrome			V8 Engine 
	Mozilla			Spider Monkey
	Edge			Chakra 
	and etc.


Comments in javascript
======================
Comments are created for documentation purpose.

Comments are used to improve readability of our code.

In javascript, we have two types of comments.

1) Single line comment 
----------------------
	It is used to comment a single line.
	ex:
		// comment here 


2) Multiple line comment 
--------------------
	It is more convenient when compare to single line comment because it is used to comment
	a single line and multiple lines.
	ex:
		/*
			-
			- comment here 
			-
		*/

Note:
-----
	HTML :  <!--  comment here -->

	CSS  :  /*    comment here  */ 


Output statement in javascript
===============================
Output statement is used to display the data or custom messages.

We have two types of output statements in javascript.

1) document.writeln()

2) console.log() 

1) document.writeln()
---------------------
It is used to display the output on browser window.

ex:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
				document.writeln("This is first output statement");
		</script>
</body>
</html>


2) console.log() 
----------------
It is used to display the output on browser console.

ex:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
				console.log("this is second output statement");
		</script>
</body>
</html>


Assignment program
==================
1) Write a java program to display given output?

input:
	IJK

output:
	IJ
	IK 
	JI 
	JK 
	KI
	KJ 

ex:
---
class  Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		String str="IJK";

		int n=str.length();

		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
			for(int j=0;j<n;j++)
			{
				if(i!=j)
				{
				System.out.println(str.charAt(i)+""+str.charAt(j));						}
			}
		}
	}
}
