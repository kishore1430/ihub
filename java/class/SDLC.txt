SDLC
=====
SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.

It is a process adopt by IT industries to develop accurate and quality of softwares.

There are six phases in SDLC.

1) Feasibility study 

2) Analysis 

3) Designing 

4) Coding 

5) Testing 

6) Delivery and Maintainence

1) Feasibility study 
---------------------
Feasibility study completed depends upon TELOS formulea.
ex:
	T - Technical Feasibility 
	E - Economical Feasibility 
	L - Legal Feasibility 
	O - Operational Feasibility 
	S - Schedule Feasibility 

The will keep all the above information in a document called BDD.
BDD stands for Business Design Document.

2) Analysis 
------------
In analysis phase, system analyst or product owner will involved.

They will seperate system requirements and software requirements.

All the above information they will keep in a document called SRS.

SRS stands Software Requirement Specification.


3) Designing 
-------------
We have two types of designing.

1) High level designing 
-----------------------
	A manager is responsible to perform high level designing.

	In high level designing we will design main modules/major modules.

2) Low level design 
--------------------
	A Team Lead/Project Lead is responsible to perform low level designing.
	
	In low level designing we will design child modules/sub modules.

They will keep above information in a document called PDD/TDD.

PDD stands Project Design Document.
TDD stands Technical Design Document.


4) coding 
----------
In coding phase, All developers will involved.

Developers are responsible to generate the build and they will perform white box testing.

Diagram: sdlc.1 

5) Testing
-----------
In testing phase, Testing Team or QA Team will involved.

Testing Team or QA Team is responsible to test the given build using a software component called STLC.

Here STLC stands for Software Testing Life Cycle.

Even they are responsible to perform Black Box Testing.


6) Delivery and maintainence
---------------------------
Before delivery we will perform UAT testing.

UAT stands for User Acceptance Testing.

It is classified into two types.

i) Alpha testing
--------------
	Company environment testing is called alpha testing.

ii)Beta testing
---------------
	Client environment testing is called beta testing.

Later our project goes to maintainence.

In India 80% of projects are maintainence projects.
