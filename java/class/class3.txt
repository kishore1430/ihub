History of Java
===============
In 1990 , Sun Micro System company took one project to develop a software called consumer electronice device which can be controlled by a remote like setup box.That time project was called Stealth project and later it is renamed to Green project.

James Gosling, Mike Sheradin and Patrick Naughton were there to develop the project.They met in a place called Aspan/Colarado to start the work with Graphic System.Then James gosling decided to use C and C++ languages to develop the project.But the problem what they have faced is C and C++ languages are system dependent.James Gosling thought why don't we create our own programming language which is system independent.

In 1991, they have developed one programming language called an OAK.OAK means strength ,itself is a coffee seed name and it is a national tree for many contries like Germany, France , USA and etc. 

Later in 1995, they have renamed OAK to Java.Java is a island of an Indonasia where first coffee of seed was produced.During the development of project they were consuming lot of coffee's.Hence symbol of java is a cup of coffee with saucer.

Identifiers
============
A name in java is called identifier.

It can be variable, method name, class name or label name.

ex:
	class  Test
	{
		public  static void  main(String[]  args)
		{
			int  x = 10;

			System.out.println(x);
		}	
	}
	Here Test, main , args and x are identifiers.

Rules to declare identifiers
-------------------------------

Rule1:
------
	Identifier will accept following characters.
	ex:
		A-Z
		a-z
		0-9
		_
		$

Rule2:
-----
	If we take other characters then we will get compile time error.
	ex:
		int emp#no; //invalid  

		int stud@no; //invalid 

Rule3:
----
	Identifier must and should starts with alphabet, underscore or dollar but not with 
	digits.
	ex:
		int  a1234; //valid 

		int  $=10;  // valid 

		int  _abcd;  //valid 		

		int  1abcd; // invalid 

Rule4:
------
	We can't take reserved words as an identifiers.
	ex:
		int   if; //invalid 

		int   else; //invalid 

Rule5:
-----
	Every identifier is a case sensitive.
	ex:
		int number;
		int NUMBER;
		int NumBer; 

Rule6:
------
	There is no length limit for an identifier but it is not recommande to take more then 
	15 characters.
