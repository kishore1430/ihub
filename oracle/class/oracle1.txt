Types of Data
=============
We have two types of data.

1) Unstructured Data 

2) Structured Data 

1) Unstructured Data 
--------------------
Data which is not in readable format is called unstructured data.

In general , meaningless data is called unstructured data.

ex:
	201	Lakemba 	SYD	NSW	AUS


2) Structured Data 
-------------------
Data which is in readable format is called structured data.

In general, meaningfull data is called structured data.

ex:
	Unit    Locality	City	State	Country
	----    ---------       ----    -----   -------
	201	Lakemba 	SYD	NSW	AUS


Oracle
========
Oracle is one of the database which is used to store structured data.

Oracle is a product of Oracle Corporation.

Oracle Database is classified into two types.

				Oracle
				   |
	|--------------------------------------------------------|
	SQL							PL/SQL
(Structured Query Language)			(Procedural/Structured Query Language)

Oracle is a case insensitive language.

But data which is present in a table is a case sensitive.


Client-Server Architecture 
==========================
In this architecture we will see how our data will store from frontend to backend.

Diagram: oracle1.1

Frontend
--------
The one which is visible to the enduser to perform some operations is called frontend.
ex:
	Java,.Net,Python,Perl,D2K and etc.

Communication Channel
---------------------
It acts like a bridge between frontend and backend.
ex:
	JDBC - Java Database Connecitivity
	ODBC - Open Database Connectivity
	PDBC - Python Database Connectivity 

Backend
-------
The one which is not visible to the enduser but it performs operations based on the instructions 
given by frontend is called backend.
ex:
	Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB, Sybase, teradata, DB2 , PostgreSQL and etc.	

Management System
=================
It is a software which is used to manage the database.

Using management system we can perform following activities very easily.

1) Adding the new data 

2) Updating the existing data 

3) Deleting the unneccesary data

4) Selecting the required data 

DBMS
=====
A database along with software which is used to manage the database is called database management system.

RDBMS
=====
If a database is designed based on relational theories is called relational database management system.
ex:
	Oracle
	MySQL
	SQL Server 
	PostgreSQL
	sybase 
	teradata 
	and etc.

SQL
====
SQL stands for Structured Query Language which is pronounce as SEQUEL.

This language is used to interact with oracle database.

It is a command based language.

It is a case insensitive language.

Every command must starts with verb i.e select, insert, update, merge, delete and etc.

Every command must ends with semicolon.

It is developed by Mr.Codd in 1972 (By IBM).


Sub Languages of SQL
=====================
We have five sub languages of SQL.

1) DDL (Data Definition Language)

2) DML (Data Manipulation Language)

3) DRL/DQL (Data Retrieve/Query Language)

4) TCL (Transaction Control Language)

5) DCL (Data Control Language)


1) DDL (Data Definition Language)
--------------------------------
This language is used to maintain the objects in database.

It collection of five commands.

ex:
	create,alter,drop,trunate and rename.


2) DML (Data Manipulation Language)
----------------------------------
This language is used to manipulate the data present in database.

It is a collection of four commands.
ex:
	insert,update,delete and merge.

3) DRL/DQL (Data Retrieve/Query Language)
-----------------------------------------
This language is used is used retrieve the data which is present in database.

It is a collection of one command.

ex:
	select 

4) TCL (Transaction Control Language)
-----------------------------------
This language is used to maintain the transaction of database.

It is a collection of three commands.

ex:
	commit,rollback and savepoint.


5) DCL (Data Control Language)
------------------------------
This language is used to control the access of data to the user.

It is a collection of two commands.

ex:
	grant and revoke 

Oracle

Establish the Connection with oracle database
==============================================
To perform any operation on database we need to establish the connection.

Once the work with database is completed then we need to close the connection.

ex:1

	SQL> connect 
	     	username: system 
	     	password: admin 
	SQL> disconnect 

ex:2

	SQL> conn
	     	username: system 
	     	password: admin 
	SQL> disc 

ex:4

	SQL> conn system/admin 
	SQL> disc 

Table
=====
Table is an object which is used to store the data.

Table is used to represent the data in the form of rows and columns.

A data which is present in a table is a case sensitive.

ex:
	-----------------------------------
	NO	|	NAME	|	ADD
	-----------------------------------
	101	|	Alan	|	USA
	-----------------------------------
	102	|	Jose	|	UAE
	-----------------------------------
	103	|	Nelson	|	UK
	-----------------------------------

	Here we have 3 rows and 3 columns.
