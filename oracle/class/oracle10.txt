Sub Queries
============
A query inside another query is called sub query.

Sub queries are used to select the records based on unknown values.

In sub queries , first inner query will execute then parent query.

We have following list of sub queries.

1) Single Row Sub Query 

2) Multiple Row Sub Query 

3) Multiple Column Sub Query 

1) Single Row Sub Query 
-------------------------
A sub query which returns only one row is called single row sub query.

Sub query can be nested upto 32 levels.

ex:
---

	SQL
	----
		select * from emp where eid=201;

	Sub-Query
	--------
		select * from emp where eid=(select eid from emp where ename='Alan');


ex:
---
	SQL
	---
		select * from emp where eid=201 and ename='Alan';

	SUB-QUERY
	--------
		select * from emp where 
		eid=(select eid from emp where ename='Alan') 
		and 
		ename=(select ename from emp where esal=8000);


Q) Write a  query to display second highest salary from emp table?

	select max(esal) from emp where esal< (select max(esal) from emp);



Q) Write a query to display all employees information who are earning more then Brook salary?

 	select * from emp where esal>(select esal from emp where ename='Brook');


Q) Write a query to delete duplicate records from student table?

	delete from student where ROWID NOT IN (
				select max(rowid) from student group by sno
				);
	

2) Multiple Row Sub query
--------------------------
If sub query returns more then one row is called multiple row sub query.

To perform multiple row sub query we need to use multiple row operators.

We have three multiple row operators.

i) ANY

ii) ALL 

ii) IN 

ex:
---
	select * from emp where esal > ANY (select esal from emp where deptno=10);
	select * from emp where esal < ANY (select esal from emp where deptno=10);

	select * from emp where esal > ALL (select esal from emp where deptno=10);

	select * from emp where esal IN (select esal from emp where deptno=10);

3) Multiple column sub query
----------------------------
When sub query returns more then one column then it is called multiple column sub query.

ex:
	select * from emp where(eid,ename,esal) IN 
		(select eid,ename,esal from emp ); 


	select eid,ename,esal from emp where(eid,ename,esal) IN 
		(select eid,ename,esal from emp ); 

	select eid,ename,esal from emp where(eid,ename,esal) IN 
		(select eid,ename,esal from emp where eid=201);



PL/SQL
=======
PL/SQL stands for Procedural and Structured Query Language.

It is a extension of SQL and having following features.

1) We can achieve programming features like control statements, loops and etc.

2) We can reduce network traffic.

3) We can display custom error messages by using exception handling.

4) We can perform related operations by using the concept of triggers.

5) It compiled and stores the program permanent to database for repeated execution.


PL/SQL block
============
A PL/SQL program is also known as PL/SQL block.

syntax:
	DECLARE
	-
	-  // Declaration section 
	-
	BEGIN
	-
	- // Executable section 
	-
	EXCEPTION
	-
	- // Exception section 
	-
	END;
	/

Declaration section 
-------------------
In declaration section, we can declare variables, cursors, exceptions and etc.
It is optional section.


Executable section
------------------
It contains lines of code which is used to complete a table.
Our actual code present in executable section.
It is mandatory.

Exception section
-------------------
It contains lines of code which are executed when exception is occured.
It is optional section.


To see the output in PL/SQL we need to use below command.
ex:
	set   serveroutput   on 



Q) Write a PL/SQL program to display Hello World?

	BEGIN
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hello World');
	END;
	/
	Here DBMS_OUTPUT is a package name.
	Here PUT_LINE is a procedure name.
	'/' is used to submit the block into database.




Q) Write a PL/SQL block to perform sum of two numbers?

	DECLARE
	A number;
	B number;
	C number;
	BEGIN
	A:=10;
	B:=20;
	C:=A+B;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(C);
	END;
	/

Declaration and initialization using single line.

	DECLARE
	A number:=10;
	B number:=20;
	C number:=A+B;
	BEGIN
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('sum of two numbers is ='||C);
	END;
	/


In PL/SQL DML operations are allowed.


Q) Write a PL/SQL program to insert a record into student table?

	DECLARE 
	L_sno number(3);
	L_sname varchar2(10);
	L_sadd varchar2(12);
	BEGIN
	L_sno:=&sno;
	L_sname:='&sname';
	L_sadd:='&sadd';
	insert into student values(L_sno,L_sname,L_sadd);
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Record Inserted');
	END;
	/


Q) Write a PL/SQL program to update student name based on student number?

	DECLARE 
	L_sname varchar2(10);
	L_sno number(3);
	BEGIN
	L_sno:=&sno;
	L_sname:='&sname';
	update student set sname=L_sname where sno=L_sno;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Record updated');
	END;
	/


Q) Write a PL/SQL program to delete student record based on student number?

	DECLARE 
	L_sno number(3);
	BEGIN
	L_sno:=&sno;
	delete from student where sno=L_sno;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Record Deleted');
	END;
	/
