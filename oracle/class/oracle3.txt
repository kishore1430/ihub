Logical Operators
==================
Logical operators are used to declare multiple conditions in where clause.

We have three logical operators.

1) AND 

2) OR 

3) NOT 

1) AND 
--------
It will return the records if all conditions are true.

In logical AND operator , we need to declare all conditions from same row.

ex:
	select * from emp where eid=201 AND ename='Alan';	

	select * from emp where eid=201 AND ename='Jessica'; // No rows selected 

	select * from emp where esal=28000 AND job='HR';

2) OR 
------
It will return the records if atleast one record is true.
ex:
	select * from emp where eid=201 OR ename='Alan';

	select * from emp where eid=201 OR ename='Ana';	

	select * from emp where eid=201 OR ename='Jessica';	


3) NOT 
-------
It will return the records except the condition.
A '<>' symbol denoted as NOT operator.


ex:
	select * from emp where NOT ename='Alan';
	select * from emp where ename<>'Alan';
	select * from emp where eid<>204;


Between operator
================
Between operator will return the records those are in the range of values.

In between operator first we will declare lower limit then higher limit.

Between operator will take the support of AND operator.

ex:
	select * from emp where eid between 201 and 206;

	select * from emp where eid between 206 and 201;//no rows selected 

	select * from emp where deptno between 10 AND 30;

IN operator
===========
It will return the records those who are matching in the list of values.

IN operator is a replacement of OR operator.

ex:
	select * from student where sno IN(101,102,103);

	select * from student where sname IN('raja','ramana','jojo');

2) Underscore(_)

Pattern matching operators will take the support of "like" keyword.

1) Percentage(%)
-----------------

Q) Write a query to display employees information whose name starts with 'B' letter?

	select * from emp where ename like 'B%';


Q) Write a query to display employees information whose name ends with 'a' letter?

	select * from emp where ename like '%a';


Q) Write a query to display employees information whose name having middle letters as 'l'?

	select * from emp where ename like '%l%';

2) Underscore(_)
----------------

	select * from emp where ename like '_e%';

Q) Write a query to display employees information whose name having second last letter as 'o'?
