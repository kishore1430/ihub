Duplicate table or Copy of a table
=================================

Using create and select command we can create a copy of a table.

syntax:
	create table <table_name as select stmt;

ex:
--
	create table students as select * from student;

	create table employees as select * from emp; 

	create table employees as select eid,ename,esal from emp;

	create table employees as select * from emp where deptno=10;

	create table employees as select * from emp where eid IN(201,202,303);

	create table employees as select * from emp where esal>45000;

	create table employees as select * from emp where comm is null;

	create table employees as select * from emp where ename like 'A%';

cl scr
=======
It is used to clear the output screen of SQL command prompt.
ex:
	cl scr


DDL commands
=============
1) create (tables)

2) alter (columns)

3) drop (tables)

4) truncate (rows/records)
 
5) rename (tables)

2) alter
----------
Using alter command we can perform following activities very easily.

i) Adding a new column 

ii) Modifying a column

iii) Renaming a column 

iv) Droping a column

i) Adding a new column 
----------------------
Using alter command we can add new column to a existing table.

syntax:
	alter table table_name ADD (col datatype(size));

ex:
	alter table student ADD (state varchar2(10),pincode number(8));

	update student set state='Telangana' where sno=101;
		
	commit; 


ii) modifying a column
----------------------
Using alter command we can update the column.

We can increase or decrease the size of the column only when existing values are fit into new size.

We can change datatype of a column only if that column is empty.

syntax:

	alter table <table_name> MODIFY (col datatype(size));

ex:
	desc student;
	alter table student MODIFY (state varchar2(12));
	desc student; 

	
	desc student;
	alter table student MODIFY (pincode varchar2(8));
	desc student;
	
iii) Renaming a column 
----------------------
Using alter command we can rename the column.

syntax:
-----
	alter table <table_name> RENAME column <old_name> to <new_name>;
ex:
	alter table student rename column pincode to country; 

	alter table student rename column state to city;

iv) Droping a column
-------------------
Using alter command we can drop the existing columns.

syntax:
------
	alter table <table_name> DROP (col1,col2,..,colN);
ex:
	alter table student DROP (city,country);


3) drop 
========
It is used to drop the table from database.

syntax:

	drop table <table_name>;

ex:
	drop table students;
	drop table employees;
	drop table emp;


4) truncate
=============
It is used to truncate the records from database table.

syntax:
	truncate table <table_name> 

ex:
	truncate table emp;
	truncate table student;
	truncate table dept; 


Q) What is the difference between delete and trunate command?

delete						truncate 
-----------					-----------
It will delete the data temperory.		It will delete the data permanently.

We can rollback the data.			We can't rollback the data.

Where clause can be used.			Where clause can't be used.

It is a DML command.				It is a DDL command.


5) rename 
==========
It is used to rename the table name.

syntax:
	rename <old_name> to <new_name>;
ex:
	rename  emp to employees;
	rename  dept to department;
	rename student to students;


Functions
===========
Functions are used to manipulate the data items and give the result.

We have two types of functions.

1) Group functions / Multiple row functions 

2) Scalar functions / Single row functions 

1) Group functions
-------------------
Group functions are applicable on multiple rows.

We have following list of group functions.

ex:
	sum(), avg(), max(), min(), count(*) and count(exp).


Q) Write a query to display sum of salary of each employee?

	select sum(esal) from emp;


Q) Write a query to display average salary of each employee?

	select avg(esal) from emp;


Q) Write a query to display highest salary from employee table?

	select max(esal) from emp;


Q) Write a query to display minimum/lowest salary from employee table?

	select min(esal) from emp;


Q) What is the difference between count(*) and count(exp)?

count(*)
-----------
It will return number of records present in database table.

It will include null records.

ex:
	select count(*) from emp;

count(exp)
----------
It will return number of values present in database table column.

It will not include null values.

ex:
	select count(esal) from emp;

	select count(comm) from emp;



userlist table
==============
drop table userlist;

create table userlist(uname varchar2(10),pwd varchar2(10));

insert into userlist values('raja','rani');

insert into userlist values('king','kingdom');

commit;

Q) Write a query to check given username and password is valid or not?

	select count(*) from userlist where uname='raja' and pwd='rani'; // 1 

	select count(*) from userlist where uname='raja' and pwd='lisa'; // 0 
	

dual table
=============
A dual table is a dummy table which contains one row and one column.

It is used to perform arithmetic operations and to see the current system date.

ex:
	select 10+20 from dual;
	select 10*20 from dual;
	select 10-10 from dual;

	select sysdate from dual;
	select current_date from dual;

2) Scalar functions
===================
We have following list of scalar functions.

i) character function 

ii) number function 

iii) Date function 

iv) Convertion function 


i) character function
----------------------
lower()
-------
	It is used to convert uppercase to lowercase.
	ex:
		select lower('ORACLE') from dual;

upper()
-------
	It is used to convert lowercase to uppercase.
	ex:
		select upper('oracle') from dual; 


initcap()
---------
	It will display initial letter capital.
	ex:
		select initcap('this is oracle training') from dual;

ceil()
-------
	It will display ceil value.
	ex:
		select ceil(10.5) from dual; //11

		select ceil(6.3) from dual; // 7 
floor()
------
	It will display floor value.
	ex:
		
		select floor(10.5) from dual; //10

		select floor(6.3) from dual; // 6

round()
-------
	It will return nearest value.
	ex:
		select round(10.5) from dual; // 11

		select round(10.4) from dual; // 10

trunc() 
------
	It will remove decimal value.
	ex:
		select trunc(10.5) from dual; //10
		select trunct(56.78) from dual; //56

replace() 
---------
	It is used to replace the character.
	ex:
		select replace(esal,'0','9') from emp;

Q) write a query to display employee information?

	select * from employee;

	select eid,
		upper(ename) as ename,
		   esal,
			deptno,
			  lower(job) as job,
				comm from emp;
