PSEUDO columns
===============
Pseudo column means a column which is not real.

We have two pseudo columns.

1) ROWNUM 

2) ROWID 

1) ROWNUM 
-----------
ROWNUM value always start with 1 and increment by 1.

ROWNUM values are temperory.

ex:
	select eid,ename,esal from emp;
	select rownum,eid,ename,esal from emp;
	select rownum,sno,sname,sadd from student;

2) ROWID 
--------
ROWID is a memory address where our records will store in a table.

ROWID is permanent.

ex:
	select rowid,rownum,eid,ename,esal from emp;
	select rowid,deptno,dname,dloc from dept;


Q) Write a query to display first three records item table?

	select * from item where rownum<=3;


Q) Write a query to display exact 4th record from emp table?

	select * from emp where rownum=4; //No rows selected 

	or

	select * from emp where rownum<=4
	minus
	select * from emp where rownum<=3;


Q) Write a query to display exact 5th record from emp table?

	select * from emp where rownum<=5
	minus
	select * from emp where rownum<=4;

TCL commands
=============
1) commit
2) rollback
3) savepoint 


1) commit
---------
It is used to make the changes permanent to database.
ex:
	drop table student;
	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));
	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');
	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');
	commit;
	select * from student; //2 records 

2) rollback
------------
It is used to undo the changes which are parmanent.
ex:
	drop table student;
	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');
	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');

	commit;

	insert into student values(103,'Alan','Texas');
	insert into student values(104,'Jose','Florida');

	select * from student; // 4 records selected

	rollback;

	select * from student; // 2 records selected 


3) savepoint 
-------------
It is used to maintain the logical marking in a database table.

Instead of complete rollback we can rollback upto save point.

syntax:
	savepoint <savepoint_name>;

ex:
	drop table student;
	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');
	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');

	savepoint sp1;

	insert into student values(103,'Alan','Texas');
	insert into student values(104,'Jose','Florida');

	savepoint sp2;
	
	insert into student values(105,'Jack','Vegas');
	insert into student values(106,'Johny','Newyork');

	select * from student;	 // 6 records selected 

	rollback to sp2;

	select * from student; // 4 records selected 

	rollback to sp1;

	select * from student; //2 records selected 

DCL commands
=============
1) Grant 
2) Revoke

Scheme : 
-------
A schema is a memory location which is used to run SQL commands.


Privileges
----------
Permission given to a user is called privileges.

Rights given to a user is called privileges.
 

We have two types of privileges.

1) System privilege 
---------------
	Permissions given by DBA to user.

2) Object privilege 
-----------------
	Permission given by one user to another user.
	

1) Grant
---------
It is used to grant the permissions to the user.

syntax:
	grant privilege1,privilege2 to <user_name>;

	
2) Revoke
----------
It is used to revoke the permissions given to the user.

syntax:
	revoke privilege1,privilege2 from <user_name>;

DBA> create user uday identified by uday;
DBA> create user swapna identified by swapna;


Uday> conn  uday/uday --logon denied 

Swapna> conn swapna/swapna --logon denied

DBA> grant connect,resource to uday,swapna;

Uday> conn  uday/uday 

Swapna> conn swapna/swapna 

Uday> 
create table employee(eid number(3),ename varchar2(10),esal number(8));
insert into employee values(501,'Jessica',10000);
insert into employee values(502,'Nelson',20000);
insert into employee values(503,'Erick',30000);
commit;
select * from employee;


Swapna> select * from employee; // table or view does not exist 

Uday> grant select on employee to swapna;

Swapna> select * from uday.employee;

Swapna> delete from uday.employee;

Uday> grant update,delete on employee to swapna;


Swapna> delete from uday.employee;
        commit;

Uday> revoke select,update,delete on employee from swapna;


DBA>  revoke connect,resource from uday,swapna;
